# Kometa Custom Configuration

This repository contains my personal **Kometa Media Manager (formerly Plex Meta Manager)** configuration files, including custom YAML setups, server connections, and collection definitions.  
It is designed for version control via GitHub and easy deployment to a Windows server or other supported environment.
