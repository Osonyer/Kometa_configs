# Kometa Custom Configuration

This repository contains my personal **Kometa Media Manager (formerly Plex Meta Manager)** configuration files, including custom YAML setups, overlays, posters, themes, and collection definitions.  
It is designed for version control via GitHub and easy deployment to Windows, Linux, or Docker environments.
